nf-core assembly and binning
================

We will use nf-core/mag workflow for metagenomics assembly and binning. It starts from reads quality control using fastp, and FastQC. Then:

- assigns taxonomy to reads using Centrifuge and/or Kraken2
- performs assembly using MEGAHIT and SPAdes, and checks their quality using Quast
- (optionally) performs ancient DNA assembly validation using PyDamage and contig consensus sequence recalling with Freebayes and BCFtools
- predicts protein-coding genes for the assemblies using Prodigal, and bins with Prokka and optionally MetaEuk
- performs metagenome binning using MetaBAT2, MaxBin2, and/or with CONCOCT, and checks the quality of the genome bins using Busco, or CheckM, and optionally GUNC.
- Performs ancient DNA validation and repair with pyDamage and freebayes
- optionally refines bins with DAS Tool
- assigns taxonomy to bins using GTDB-Tk and/or CAT and optionally identifies viruses in assemblies using geNomad, or Eukaryotes with Tiara

-------

Before running the workflow, we need to prepare the compressed fastq files as input::

  cd /mnt/WGS-data
  pigz -k read1.fq
  pigz -k read2.fq

Then we can start the mag workflow as follows::

  cd ..
  mkdir outputs
  nextflow run nf-core/mag -profile singularity --input 'WGS-data/read{1,2}.fq.gz' --outdir outputs
