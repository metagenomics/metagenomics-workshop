.. note:: Most jobs above will be started in the backgroud using the ``&`` at the end of each command, 
          which allows you to continue working in the shell. You can watch your running jobs by typing ``top`` 
          (hit ``q`` to exit ``top``). You can look into the log-files by typing e.g. ``less velvetg_31.log``.
